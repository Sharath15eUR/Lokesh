=> senerio (1) mac table cleared  src node apr not cleared 


1) create a  simple network using cisco packet tracer with switch and end nodes

2) configure  static ip addr to the nodes as switch used create a single network and dont use different network ip addr for different end nodes 

3) create an http request for pc 1 with ip 192.168.1.1 to .3 machine 

4) at current state mac addr table of switch was empty so no direct routing and the packet was broadcasted to every other port

5) pc3 with .3 addr check its ip and reply to  the  request and the response sent to pc 1 through switch

6) pc2 with .2 addr get inbound request but dosent send any reply

7) mac addr of pc1 and pc 2 are added to mac address-table of the switch , further route can be directly sent to the intended node pc1 or pc 3 directly

also the ether net frame like src,dest mac addr , ether-type (type of layer 3 protocol) , preamble (sync communication ), frame check seq (fcs ) for error detection , sfd (start frame delimiter)  are also analyzed throughout the pdu transmition process.


=> senerio (2) (apr enty of src node cleared)

when arp table of pc 1 was cleared arp request was sent by pc1 to find the dest mac addr and with this process switch learn the mac addr and send data directly to pc 3
