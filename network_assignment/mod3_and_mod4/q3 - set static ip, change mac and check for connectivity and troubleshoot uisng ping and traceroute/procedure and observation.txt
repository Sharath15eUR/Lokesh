1 ) check the interfaces and modify mac :-

use 
	ifconfig / ip c
cmd to check about the current status and detail of the interface

=> use following cmd to modify the mac addr

sudo ip link set eth0 down
sudo ip link set eth0 address 00:11:22:33:44:55
sudo ip link set eth0 up

or 

sudo ifconfig eth0 down
sudo ifconfig eth0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55
sudo ifconfig eth0 up


2) add / set static ip addr to device

sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.1/24 dev eth0

sudo ip route add default via 192.168.1.100 // to set default gateway for all mismatching route not in the routing table entry


3) trouble shoot and check connectivity using ping and traceroute

	cmd => ping <ipaddr > ;to check the connectivity
		traceroute <ip> ; to check the routes the pdu take during the transmition


configure the ip addr and mac addr properly

check with ping for reachability of the nodes

check the traceroute to check the path it take during the route

if some thing fails in between do follow
	=> use traceroute cmd to check where the packet drops or fails and check the config of the device where packet dropped if it is 
	   with in your access like your firewall , switch , router etc ; check for issues like proper subnetting, nat configuration , acl 	   management of the devices like firewall, route with acl features etc

resolve the issue found using the inspection above and check again for the proper working of the network
