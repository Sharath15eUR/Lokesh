1) create a network as shown in img 0 and assign the ip to the end host as mentioned

2) config the gateway ip for each subnet on the router4 as mentioned in the img 2 and 3

3) for router5 also assign the ip addr as show by ip int br .

4) by default the connected routes will be created for all the network configured on the router with the interface to which the network ip was assigned.

5) in router 5 configure a static route to 10.0.0.0/26 which is the first subnet consist pc0(1.0.0.0.2) and pc3 ( 10.0.0.3)

with ip route cmd

6) now test the connectivity using ping and traceroute cmd , refer img 5 ,6, 7 , you can see the connectivity fails as packet successfully sent for pc 8 (192.168.0.2) to pc1 through router5 and router4 as static route of 10.0.0.0/26 network configured on router5 , but the reply from  pc1 not reach router 5 as no matching route for 192.168.0.0/24 the root network of pc8 not found in router 4 so the reply packet dropped.

7) configure the static route to the above network mentioned in point 6  as in img 8

8) refer 9 , now ping and traceroute work due to the addition of static routes.

9) other subnets are not reachable as of now as route for those subnet are not  configured ont router 5 and only route for 10.0.0.0/26 configures , so other are not reachable , if need we can configure later.
