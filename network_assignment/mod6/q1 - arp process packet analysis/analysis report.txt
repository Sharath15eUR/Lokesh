ARP (ADDRESS RESOLUTION PROTOCOL)

arp packet was sent on the network  to identify the mac addr of the dest ip in that network

arp request => the request packet was a broadcast packet sent to all the device in with sender mac,ip and reciver ip filled and reciver mac 		set blank .

arp reply => arp reply was the unicast packet from the intended host who has the requested ip on the network , it takes the ip and mac addr 
	     from the apr request and send arp reply unicast packet to that host .

arp probe => arp probe was the packe sent on the network with the arp client / node to check weather any other node on the network has the 	     same ip addr  , so the src ip was blank 0.0.0.0 and target mac was also blank with target ip as the ip addr as the ip allocated 	     to the client / sender by dhcp process. the probe msg was as broad cast packet.

	     arp probe was using during connection and ip assigenment phase.

arp announcement => arp announcement was also a broad cast packet sent to all device in the network to announce the source device have the 		    respective ip and mac addr , so all the device can update the arp table with the sent details and the target ip is same 	            as src ip , so that in case of any other node have the same ip after probe process  another node with the same ip will 
		    also respond to the announce msg and packet collision will happen , else the data will be updated on the arp table of		    other nodes in the network
