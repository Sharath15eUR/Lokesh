iPerf is a network testing tool used to measure bandwidth and performance. It operates in a client-server model, supporting TCP, UDP, multicast, and reverse testing. It measures throughput, latency, jitter, and packet loss.

1. Basic Client-Server TCP Test
Command for Server: iperf3 -s
Explanation: The server listens for incoming connections and measures the performance.

Command for Client: iperf3 -c <server_ip>
Explanation: The client connects to the server and sends TCP traffic to measure throughput.

2. UDP Test
Command for Server: iperf3 -s
Explanation: The server listens for UDP traffic.

Command for Client: iperf3 -c <server_ip> -u -b 100M
Explanation: The client sends UDP traffic to the server with a bandwidth of 100 Mbps. -u specifies UDP mode, and -b 100M sets the bandwidth.

3. Test with Specific Port
Command for Server: iperf3 -s -p 12345
Explanation: The server listens on port 12345.

Command for Client: iperf3 -c <server_ip> -p 12345
Explanation: The client connects to the server on port 12345.

4. Reverse Mode Test
Command for Server: iperf3 -s
Explanation: The server listens for incoming connections.

Command for Client: iperf3 -c <server_ip> -R
Explanation: The -R flag reverses the data flow, meaning the server sends data to the client instead of the client sending data to the server. Useful for testing server upload capacity.

5. Bidirectional (Duplex) Test
Command for Server: iperf3 -s
Explanation: The server listens for connections.

Command for Client: iperf3 -c <server_ip> -d
Explanation: The -d flag enables bidirectional testing, where data flows in both directions simultaneously. Measures throughput in both directions (client-to-server and server-to-client).

6. Multicast Test
Command for Server: iperf3 -s -B 239.0.0.1
Explanation: The server binds to the multicast address 239.0.0.1 and listens for multicast traffic.

Command for Client: iperf3 -c 239.0.0.1
Explanation: The client connects to the multicast group 239.0.0.1 to receive traffic.

7. Customizing Packet Size and Other Options
Command for Server: iperf3 -s
Explanation: The server listens for incoming connections.

Command for Client: iperf3 -c <server_ip> -l 1500 -w 128K
Explanation: The -l 1500 option sets the packet size to 1500 bytes, and -w 128K sets the TCP window size to 128 KB.

8. Test with Specific Duration and Reporting Interval
Command for Server: iperf3 -s
Explanation: The server listens for incoming connections.

Command for Client: iperf3 -c <server_ip> -t 30 -i 5
Explanation: The -t 30 option runs the test for 30 seconds, and -i 5 reports results every 5 seconds.
