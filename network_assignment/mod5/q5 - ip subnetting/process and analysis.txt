given ip addr = > 192.168.1.0/24 class c ip addr 

total available host is 256 as 2^8 now to divide it into 4 network divide 256 by 4 so 64 host each  subnet

2^6 = 64 so last 6 bits are left as host addr and remaining 26 bits out of 32 bits are used as network addr so by CIDR /26 is the subnet addr used.

0-63 , 64-127, 128-191, 192-255  are the 4 range of subnet in 192.1681.X network with /26 subnet

The network add of the 4 subnet are 192.16802.0/26 , 192.168.1.64/26 , 192.168.128/26 . 192.168.1.192/26 

the starting addr are reserved as network addr  and the end addr like .63 , .127 ,.191 , .255 was used for broadcast in each subnet


so each subnet has 62 ip addr to provide to hosts.


config the ip add leaving the network and broadcast addr as per the attached image , check ping with in the network (it works fine)

when you try to reach the device outside the subnet no matching route found and also no inside same subnet so packet dropped , to avoid 

config the default gateway for the subnet as the router interface ip connecting this subnet to router, follow the same for all subnet , the 

default entry with /26 CIDR and .0 , .63 ,.128 and .192 addr was used to forward the packet belong to that subnet throught the respective 

router port
