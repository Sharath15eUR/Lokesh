for performing arp spoofing attack config the network as per the givern image

monitor / find out the mac addr of the default gateway by analyzing the packets or seeing the arp enty

in the malicious actor machine her pc1 change the mac addr to that of the default gateway

observation:
	1) no problem occur if pc1 did not perform any function and remain idle in the network
	2) if pc 1 perform operation gateway and pc1 have same mac so arp spoofing attack occur and request time out happens
	3) we can use sniffer to capture the packets and analyze it for further attack

refer the images attached for detailed operation and results
