A backhaul is the connection that bridges a local network  to the internet. 


=> fiber optic

Capable of delivering speeds ranging from 1 Gbps to over 10 Gbps, fiber offers minimal latency  and high reliability.
It is widely used in cities, large enterprises, and academic institutions .


=> DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) 

This  operates over traditional copper telephone lines, offering speeds between 10 and 100 Mbps, it provides moderate reliability, its latency is higher ,older model


=> Ethernet 

Preferred for enterprise Wi-Fi networks, office infrastructures, and campus access point connections. 
It provides high reliability and low latency with speeds often exceeding 1 Gbps.

=> Microwave 

Supports internet connectivity in remote regions, as well as ISP backbone networks and cellular tower connections.
It can provide multi-Gbps speeds with latencies around 1â€“10 ms, making it a viable alternative to fiber in challenging deployment scenarios.

=> Satellite

Often used in remote locations where terrestrial networks are unavailable, satellite-based backhaul can offer speeds up to 1 Gbps. 
However, it suffers from high latency due to the long-distance signal travel.


Power Line Communication (PLC)

Utilizes existing electrical wiring to transmit data, making it a cost-effective solution in certain deployments 
It is often used in smart grid applications and home networking scenarios where traditional cabling is impractical.

my home network use air fiber connection which use microwave  to connect to  cellphone tower , but reciver connected to gateway router via ethernet so the backhaul used is ethernet backhaul.
