wifi is a duplex communication where all the frames require ACK from the reciver before sending the next frame , but the issue is ACK for each frame increase the overhead and reduce the throughput

to overcome this frame aggregation was used and the aggregated frames are block ACK with the start frame number and the position for the framed recived succesfuly

the frame sequence no missing in ack are retransmitted and this reduce the overhead along with hight throughput due imporved utilization of the medium .
