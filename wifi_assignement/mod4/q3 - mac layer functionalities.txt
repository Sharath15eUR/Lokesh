mac layer determine and handle how devices communicate with the wireless medium without any issues.The mac frame to manage these process are broadly categorize into 3 typs 

=> management frames
=> control frames
=> data frames

=<managementframes>=

it handle the network discovery , auth , association and maintinence with frmaes like becon transmition , probe req and res
auth with process like epol , dissocation , power magnt with sleep and buffering during sleep (ps poll , null data) etc 

its main purpose to to manage the communication setup and maintaince overhead

=<contrl frames>=

cntrl frames manage the activites like flow , error , medium access operations

use RTS , CTS in CSMA/CA  for virtual sensing of carrier and coordinate communication, ACK and Block ACk  to confirm the reception of frames and facilitate retransmition , NAV used along with duration in header to reserve the medium for efficient medium usage, also provide legacy frame compatibility .

=<data plane>=

handle features like  frame encapsulation, mac addressing for header (1-4), qos prioritization with different queue for different topic like voice , video, besteffort, bg. 

enc/dec of data , flow contrl by sharing the capability and using the appropriate params along with flow cntrl and Frame Aggregation for improved data rate and throughput

these are the different frames in wifi mac haader
