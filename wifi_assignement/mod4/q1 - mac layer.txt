=> The MAC (Media Access Control) layer plays importnt role in managing how devices on a wireless network communicate with each other.

=> It is a sublayer of the Data Link Layer, which is Layer 2 in the osi model. In the context of wifi the MAC layer is responsible for coordinating access to the shared wireless medium. 

=> Unlike wired networks where each device may have a dedicated cable wifi uses rf waves so  devices must take turns using the same frequency to avoid collisions.

=> The MAC layer ensures this happens efficiently using mechanisms like CSMA/CA ,  It also handles frame addressing, error detection, frame sequencing, acknowledgments, and retransmissions, which are essential for reliable communication over an inherently unstable and noisy medium like wireless.

=> The MAC layer manages authentication and association processes that are vital for connecting to wifi networks securely.
