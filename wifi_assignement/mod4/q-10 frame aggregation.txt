frame aggregation is combining multiple mac frames to improve the spectral usage due to reduced overhead and increase throughput

=> A-MPDU

multiple mpdu with separate mac header are aggregated with signle phy layer header , if any one sub frame is corrupted , as each frame as separate crc only corrupted frame retransmition needed but high overhead.

=> A=MSDU

in this msdu are aggregated with single mac and phy header so the overhead decreased but the issues is if any one sub frame fail all need to be re transmited

=> A=MSDU insid A-mpdu

multiple msdu like 2 or 3 are aggregated with signle mac header and multiple similar mpdu chunks are aggregated with same phy header this is the middle ground b/w the above 2 method and provide better effienct along with data security.

block ack was used in the aggregation
