in wifi csma/ca was used predomoninently for mac control efficiently

3 type of methodologies are used primarily

1) pcf(point coordination function)

	old and deprecated , AP maintan list of client and poll the client from the available pool and schedule the communication , only the client polled by ap can perform data transfer , it has less conjestion but low throughput and spectral effiency

2) dcf ( distributed conridination function)
	
	use csma/ca , it physically senee the energy level of the medium along with csma/ca with cts, rts etc to virtyally sense the medium and access it , it is distributed but it does not have qos but improved spectral usage

use contention time ( same for all traffic)

3) edca( enhanced distributed channel access)

it include qos with dcf by using different contention time and period for each type of traffic with less contention time (cwmin , cwmax) less cwmax for priority traffic , so backoof reduced and qos can be dones
