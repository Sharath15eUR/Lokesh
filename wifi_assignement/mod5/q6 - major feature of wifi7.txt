wifi 7 (802.11be) introduces several significant feature over previous gen like enhance speed, capacity, and efficiency in wireless networks. 

it include key  features such ashigher data rates, supporting up to 46 Gbps through the use of wider channel bandwidths (up to 320 MHz). 

It also utilizes 16 spatial streams for increased throughput. wifi 7 incorporates 4096-QAM which allows for denser data transmission, further boosting speeds

to improve performance in crowded environments, it introduces multi-link operation (MLO), enabling devices to transmit and receive across multiple bands simultaneously, reducing latency and improving reliability'

wifi 7 also enhances channel access efficiency with enhanced MU-MIMO, allowing better management of simultaneous data streams

target wake time (TWT) is optimized, leading to more efficient power management for IoT devices
