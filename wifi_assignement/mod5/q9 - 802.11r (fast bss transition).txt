Fast BSS Transition (FT) 802.11r standard is a feature that enhances roaming performance in wifi networks, especially for mobile devices. Its main goal is to reduce the delay that occurs when a device moves between access points (APs) within the same network. 

Traditionally every time a device switches AP it must go through a full authentication process, which can take several hundred milliseconds,  for real-time applications like voip, video streaming it is an issue.

802.11r solves this by allowing the device to complete key negotiation with neighboring APs in advance, making handoffs almost seamless.

There are two types of Fast BSS Transition:

Over-the-Air FT: The client communicates directly with the target AP during the handoff process.

Over-the-DS FT (Distribution System): The client communicates with the target AP through the current AP over the wired network (distribution system).

Both types aim to reduce handoff time and ensure smoother transitions
