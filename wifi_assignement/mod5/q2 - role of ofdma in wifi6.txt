OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access)  enhance the performance of wifi 6 (802.11ax) by significantly improving the efficiency of how data is transmitted over the wireless network

previous wifi standards that use OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing), where each channel is allocated to a single user at a time

OFDMA divides a channel into smaller sub-channels called Resource Units (RU), which can be assigned to multiple users simultaneously

this allows wifi 6 to handle multiple devices more efficiently, reducing latency and increasing overall network throughput, especially in dense environments like offices, stadiums, or smart homes with many connected devices

with parallel transmition and reduced idle time OFDMA minimizes contention resulting in faster and more reliable connections for all users on the network
