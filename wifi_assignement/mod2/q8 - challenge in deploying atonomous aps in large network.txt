The challenges faced when using autonomous AP s in large network like university are follows:

=> interference
=> configuration and management issue
=> position and placement of accesspoint
=> load balancing between APS
=> troubleshooting issues
=> high cost of maintainece
=> policy enforcement and security configuration issues
=> handoff handling issues 
=> network and vlan isolation and management issues

all these issue arise as the control was not managed centrally and remain locally to each individual AP and not feasible for huge network like university or enterprise
