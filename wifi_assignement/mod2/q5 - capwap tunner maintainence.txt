CAPWAP (Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points) is a protocol used for communication between a Wireless Access Point (AP) and a Wireless LAN Controller (WLC). The CAPWAP tunnel ensures that the AP and WLC can exchange control and management messages for things like configuration, status, and data traffic.

The maintenance of the CAPWAP tunnel involves several steps and processes:

=>  CAPWAP Tunnel Establishment:

When the AP boots up, it does not know the IP address of the WLC. To establish the CAPWAP tunnel, the AP uses a few methods:

DNS Lookup: The AP may perform a DNS query for a predefined WLC hostname.

DHCP Option 43: The AP can receive the WLC s IP address from a DHCP server.

Static Configuration: In some cases, the WLC s IP address may be statically configured on the AP.

After obtaining the WLCâ€™s address, the AP initiates a connection by sending a CAPWAP discovery request to the controller.

=>  CAPWAP Tunnel Setup (CAPWAP Discovery and join prrocess):

Discovery Request: The AP sends a CAPWAP discovery request to the WLC, which includes its MAC address and other information.

Controller Response: The WLC sends a CAPWAP discovery response with its IP address and any relevant information.

Join Request: Once the AP discovers the WLC, it sends a CAPWAP join request, including the APs capabilities and configuration.

Join Response: The WLC replies with a join response that includes the APs configuration, including SSID, VLAN settings, security parameters, etc.


=> CAPWAP Tunnel Maintenance:

Heartbeat Messages: After the tunnel is established, the AP and WLC exchange heartbeat messages to ensure the tunnel remains active. This allows both devices to detect failures (such as a link failure) and re-establish communication if necessary.

Keep-alive: The AP and WLC send keep-alive messages (every few seconds) to check if the link is still valid and the tunnel is operational. If the WLC fails to receive a keep-alive message within a specified time (timeout), the tunnel is considered down, and the AP may attempt to reconnect.

Error Recovery: If an error occurs or the tunnel is interrupted ( due to network failures or AP mobility), the CAPWAP protocol includes mechanisms for the AP to automatically retry or reconnect to the WLC.

=> Data Forwarding (Optional Tunneling Mode):

In CAPWAP data can be forwarded in one of two ways:

Centralized Mode (Tunnel Mode): In this mode, all data traffic from clients connected to the AP is sent through the CAPWAP tunnel to the WLC for processing and forwarding.

Local Mode: The AP can also be configured to forward traffic locally, without tunneling it back to the WLC, but this depends on the configuration.

=> Session Timeout & Tunnel Tear Down:
If the AP and WLC stop communicating due to a prolonged failure or network issue, the tunnel will eventually time out and be torn down. This means the AP will either go into a fallback mode or attempt to reconnect to the WLC, depending on the configuration.
