when WLC deployed in WAN , configuring AP in flexconnect mode in local n/w would be a good choice.

In FlexConnect mode control operations are handeled by WLC and data palne operations are handled by AP itself to reduce latency and load for processing the data operation in WLC.

when WLC went down flexconnect mode make AP to be in standalone mode , it cache the control configurations sent from WLC and in standalone mode it can route the data traffic and handle authenitation and  authorization locally using the cached information.

when WLC reconnects it take over the responsibility of control operation so this mode increase high availability and faster communication.
