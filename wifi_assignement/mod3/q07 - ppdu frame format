The key components of a PHY Layer Frame (PPDU) are:

=> Preamble:

    Purpose: For synchronization and channel estimation.

    Components:

    Short Training Field (STF): Helps with automatic gain control and signal detection.

    Long Training Field (LTF): Used for channel estimation and equalization.

    Signal Field (SIG): Contains information about modulation, coding rate, and frame length.

    The preamble is transmitted using a robust low-modulation scheme ( BPSK).

=> Header (PLCP Header):

    Purpose: Provides the receiver with information on how to decode the payload.

    Contents:

    Rate: Modulation and coding scheme (MCS).

    Length: Size of the MAC payload.

    Service field: Reserved control bits.

    Parity/Error Check: Ensures header integrity.

    The header is decoded before the payload to help prepare the receiver.

=> Payload (PSDU â€“ PLCP Service Data Unit):

    Purpose: Carries the actual user data from the MAC layer.


=> Encoding/Modulation:
     Based on PHY header parameters like MCS, channel width, and guard interval.
