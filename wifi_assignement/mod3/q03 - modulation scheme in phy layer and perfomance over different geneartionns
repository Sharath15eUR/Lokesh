Modulation schemes in the Physical (PHY) layer of a wireless communication system are used to encode data onto a carrier signal by varying some characteristic of the carrier wave (like amplitude, frequency, or phase) , these schemes are critical for determining how data is transmitted over the air. The key goal of modulation is to balance the tradeoff between data rate, signal robustness, and range, depending on the specific needs of the wireless environment.


At the PHY layer, modulation schemes are responsible for converting the digital data (bits) into analog signals that can be transmitted over radio waves. The modulation process involves:

Mapping Digital Data to Symbols: Data bits ( 0s and 1s) are grouped into symbols. The number of bits per symbol is determined by the modulation scheme. For example:

BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying): 1 bit per symbol (either 0 or 1).

QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying): 2 bits per symbol (00, 01, 10, or 11).

16-QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation): 4 bits per symbol (16 different combinations).

Carrier Wave Modification: The symbols are mapped onto the carrier signal by altering certain properties of the wave (e.g., phase, frequency, or amplitude).

Transmission: The signal is transmitted over the air via the radio channel, and at the receiver end, demodulation takes place to extract the transmitted bits from the received signal.

Comparison of Modulation Schemes

The choice of modulation scheme impacts performance in terms of throughput, signal robustness (against noise and interference), and power efficiency. Here’s a breakdown of some commonly used modulation schemes:

=> BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying):

    Data Rate: 1 bit per symbol.

    Robustness: Highly robust to noise and interference because it uses only two possible states.

    Use Case: Typically used in environments where signal quality is poor (low SNR).

    Drawback: Low data rate.

=> QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying):

    Data Rate: 2 bits per symbol.

    Robustness: Better than BPSK, but still relatively robust in noisy environments.

    Use Case: Widely used in many communication systems, including Wi-Fi standards like 802.11a/g.

    Drawback: Offers higher data rates than BPSK but still limited.

=>16-QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation):

    Data Rate: 4 bits per symbol.

    Robustness: More sensitive to noise and interference than BPSK and QPSK due to a higher number of signal points.

    Use Case: Used in scenarios where there’s a relatively strong signal (higher SNR), and higher data rates are required.

    Drawback: Susceptible to signal degradation due to noise or interference.

=> 64-QAM:

    Data Rate: 6 bits per symbol.

    Robustness: Even more sensitive to noise and interference than 16-QAM.

    Use Case: Used in modern Wi-Fi standards ( 802.11a/g/n/ac/ax) to achieve high data rates in good signal conditions.

    Drawback: Requires high SNR to perform reliably.

=> 256-QAM:

    Data Rate: 8 bits per symbol.

    Robustness: The least robust modulation scheme in terms of noise tolerance, requiring a very high-quality signal.

    Use Case: Used in advanced Wi-Fi standards (802.11ac/ax ) to provide ultra-high data rates under ideal conditions.
