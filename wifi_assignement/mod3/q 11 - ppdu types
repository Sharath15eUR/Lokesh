=> Legacy PPDU (802.11a/g)

    This is the basic OFDM format used for single-user communication with limited modulation schemes (up to 64-QAM).
    Preamble: Short Training Field (STF), Long Training Field (LTF), SIGNAL field
    Field: MAC frame payload

=>  HT PPDU (802.11n – High Throughput)

    HT PPDU enables MIMO and frame aggregation, offering better throughput and reliability.

    Fields:

    Legacy Preamble (for backward compatibility)
    HT-SIG (High Throughput Signal)
    HT-STF (Short Training Field)
    HT-LTFs (Long Training Fields for MIMO)
    payload (MAC frame)

=> VHT PPDU (802.11ac – Very High Throughput)

    VHT PPDU adds support for MU-MIMO (downlink) and wider channels (up to 160 MHz), increasing payload rates up to 6.9 Gbps.

    Fields:

    Legacy Preamble
    VHT-SIG-A and VHT-SIG-B
    VHT-STF, VHT-LTFs
    payload

=>HE PPDU (802.11ax – High Efficiency)
    HE PPDU use OFDMA to increase effiency along with help of methods like BSS Colouring
    
    Fields:

    HE-SIG-A, HE-SIG-B
    HE-STF, HE-LTF
    payload
