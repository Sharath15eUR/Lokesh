=> PPDU (Physical Layer Protocol Data Unit):

    PPDU is the actual data unit that is transmitted at the PHY layer in Wi-Fi communication.

    It consists of a series of bits that includes both data and control information necessary for transmission. A PPDU typically consists of a preamble (for synchronization and channel estimation) , header  and  data field (which carries the actual payload).

    In simple terms, a PPDU is the "packet" at the physical layer of Wi-Fi communication.

=>  PLCP (Physical Layer Convergence Protocol):

    The PLCP is part of the PHY layer that prepares data for transmission by the physical medium.

    It serves as an interface between the MAC (Medium Access Control) layer and the PMD (Physical Medium Dependent) layer.

    The PLCP defines how the MAC layerdata ( MPDU) is encapsulated into a PPDU. It handles the framing of the data, adding a PLCP preamble and header, and ensures that the data is formatted correctly for the physical transmission.

    The PLCP preamble contains synchronization and signaling information for the receiving device, helping it to decode the incoming signal.

=>  PMD (Physical Medium Dependent):

    The PMD defines the actual characteristics and mechanisms of the physical medium ( radio frequencies, modulation schemes, and the transmission and reception of signals).

    It is the part of the PHY layer responsible for transmitting and receiving the actual radio signals (like modulation and demodulation).

    The PMD specifies how the bits (from the PPDU) are actually mapped onto the wireless medium, including factors like frequency bands, modulation types ( QPSK, 16-QAM), and the use of antennas ( MIMO).
