if 2 nodes assigned same ipaddr in an network then problem arise when populating the mac table in l2 devices of the network , 

1) arp fail to assign ip->mac properly as multiple node have same ip addr
	1.1) if both are not communicating simulatneously mac table keep on changing and communication possible
	1.2) if both communicate at same time then then one node with more connection or existing resolved entries get the ip->mac maping
	1.3) else both the node become un rechable as both resolve to same arp request and due to collisin packet dropped  , mac table not 
		populate so no data transfer

2) dhcp server will figure out the issue and assing unique ipaddr (if dhcp used) or manual ressignement need to be done in case of static ip 
   assigenment 

conclution = > mostly both node become unreachable and arise unexpected behaviour based on the traffic and connection exist at the time of 
request in the network
